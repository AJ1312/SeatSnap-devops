## About The Project 🚀

SeatSnap is a modern, intuitive web application designed to provide a seamless ticket discovery and purchasing experience, similar to popular platforms like Ticketmaster. This repository primarily houses the frontend application, demonstrating a robust and automated deployment strategy through advanced DevOps practices.

While this repository focuses on the frontend and its deployment, it is envisioned to be the user-facing component of a larger system.

### Built With 🛠️

* **Frontend**: (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js, HTML/CSS/JavaScript - *Specify your actual frontend stack here*)
* **Containerization**: Docker 🐳
* **CI/CD**: Jenkins ⚙️
* **Orchestration**: Kubernetes ☸️
* **Cloud Provider**: AWS ☁️
* **Monitoring**: Prometheus 🔥, Grafana 📊

### Current Status 🟢

The SeatSnap frontend application is successfully deployed and accessible. The **continuous integration** and **continuous deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline is fully operational, ensuring that new features and bug fixes are delivered efficiently to the production environment.

**Backend Status:** The backend services for SeatSnap are currently *not deployed* as part of this project's scope. This project specifically highlights the frontend deployment and the DevOps practices applied to it.

## Deployment & DevOps Practices pipeline 🚀

This project showcases a comprehensive implementation of **DevOps principles** for the frontend application's lifecycle, from code commit to production deployment.

### CI/CD Pipeline 🔗

The CI/CD pipeline is orchestrated using **Jenkins** and automates the following stages:

* **Source Code Management**: Code is pulled from a **GitHub repository** 🐙.
* **Code Quality Analysis**: **SonarQube** performs static code analysis to maintain high code quality standards ✨.
* **Deep Level Scanning**: **OWASP ZAP** is utilized for deep-level file system scanning to identify security vulnerabilities 🕵️‍♀️.
* **Vulnerability Scanning**: **Trivy** performs container image vulnerability scanning 🛡️.
* **Docker Image Creation**: The frontend application is containerized into a **Docker image** 📦.
* **Application Testing**: Automated tests are executed on the application running within its Docker container ✅.
* **Deployment**: The tested Docker image is deployed to the production environment 🚀.
* **Email Notification**: Stakeholders receive automated email notifications about pipeline status 📧.

### Infrastructure 🏗️

The SeatSnap frontend is deployed on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, leveraging key cloud services for scalability and reliability:

* **EC2 Instances**: Virtual servers hosting the application components 💻.
* **Docker Containers**: The application runs within Docker containers for isolated and consistent environments 🐳.
* **Kubernetes Cluster**: The containers are orchestrated and managed by a **Kubernetes cluster**, ensuring high availability and efficient resource utilization 🌐.
* **Load Balancing**: An **AWS Load Balancer** distributes incoming traffic across the Kubernetes pods, enhancing performance and reliability ⚖️.
* **Custom Domain Mapping**: The application is accessible via a user-friendly custom domain, configured through AWS Route 53 🔗.

### Monitoring 👀

Continuous monitoring is established to ensure the application's health and performance:

* **Prometheus**: Collects metrics from the Kubernetes cluster and application 🔥.
* **Grafana**: Provides dashboards and visualizations for real-time monitoring and alerting 📊.

## Getting Started 🏁

To get a local copy of the frontend up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites 📋

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn
* Git

### Local Development 💻

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/seatsnap-frontend.git](https://github.com/your_username/seatsnap-frontend.git)
    cd seatsnap-frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or another port as specified by your frontend framework).

## Usage 💡

Once deployed, SeatSnap allows users to:

* Browse a wide range of events (concerts, sports, theater, etc.) 🎭.
* View event details, including dates, times, venues, and seat availability 🗓️.
* (Future: Select seats and proceed to a secure checkout process) 💳.

---

## Future Roadmap 🗺️

* Implement full backend integration for user authentication, ticket management, and payment processing ➡️.
* Enhance frontend UI/UX with advanced search and filtering options 🔍.
* Add push notifications for event updates 🔔.
* Integrate third-party APIs for venue maps and detailed event information 📍.
* Explore serverless functions for specific backend functionalities ☁️.

---

## Future Roadmap
This project is solely implemented with frontend interface of our SeatSnap site and integrating it with DevOPS and agile methodologies.
